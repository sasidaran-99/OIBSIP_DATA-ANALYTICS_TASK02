# 🧠 Customer Segmentation Analysis using RFM and K-Means

This project performs customer segmentation using **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)** analysis combined with **K-Means clustering** to group customers based on their purchasing behavior. It helps businesses tailor marketing strategies to different customer groups.

---

## 📊 Objective

To segment customers based on their purchasing patterns in order to:
- Identify high-value and at-risk customers
- Enable targeted marketing campaigns
- Improve customer retention and engagement

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python 🐍
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas, numpy
- seaborn, matplotlib
- scikit-learn

---

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset contains anonymized customer purchase records, including:
- **Customer ID**
- **Invoice Date**
- **Purchase Amount**
- **Quantity**
- **Transaction Frequency**


---

## 📌 Workflow

1. **Data Collection**
2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
3. **RFM Feature Engineering**
4. **Standardization of RFM scores**
5. **K-Means Clustering**
6. **Cluster Profiling & Insights**
7. **Visualizations & Heatmaps**
8. **Recommendations**

---

## 📈 Visualizations

- RFM Distribution Histograms
- Elbow Method for Optimal K
- Cluster Heatmaps
- Cluster Scatter Plots (Recency vs Frequency, etc.)


---

## 🔍 Insights

Each cluster was analyzed to extract behavioral patterns. For example:
- **Cluster 0**: High Recency, High Frequency — Loyal Customers
- **Cluster 1**: Low Monetary, Low Frequency — At-Risk or One-time Shoppers
- **Cluster 2**: High Monetary — High-value customers
- **Cluster 3**: Recent & Frequent but low spend — Engaged Newcomers

## ✅ Recommendations

- Send special promotions to high-value customers
- Re-engage at-risk segments with personalized offers
- Reward loyal frequent shoppers with a loyalty program
